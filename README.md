The overview of this application is the idea that we want companies and businesses to keep track of the COVID-19 virus that employees could be spreading within facilities and offices. Each employee that is working under a company using this application will each have their own unique profile that will keep track of where they have been in the building or facility. An example of this would be: An employee coming to the office in the morning would have to use their UserID and indicate the time they have arrived to the office, every time an employee goes to a different floor of the building, and/or if they have come into contact with anyone while at the office or facility. This will allow for the application to keep track of when and where each employee has been inside the office so that if an employee does come into contact with COVID-19, it will be very simple to track down the root of the spread and have the employees that came into contact with the virus to stay home to further prevent the spread of COVID-19.
